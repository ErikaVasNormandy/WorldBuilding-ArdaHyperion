## A Collection of World Building Components for Arda Hyperion
This page has some semblance of organization, but mainly tidbits that go into more detail without making you read an essay.

All of these take place in a setting called Arda Hyperion, a timeline where humanity has discovered Atomcraft, the ability to interface with the Operating System running the Universe.

While this technically includes extraordinary abilities such as matter manipulation, teleportation, and energy conduction, their true hallmark is their expertise in the creation and use of Extradimensional Material (EM).

For better or worse, humans have discovered how to conduct what is essentially Magic, and apply it on an industrial scale to their technology, economies, and infrastructure. But all resources are finite, and for every miracle there must be a consequence. Ever the intrepid craftsmen, humanity's hunger for resources and energy, whether Earthbound or Cosmic in nature, will have its price.


Intro
Arda Hyperion is tentative webseries set in an alternate timeline where humans have discovered Atomcraft: limited read-write access to the Operating System running the Universe. Those who practice Atomcraft are known as "Atomancers", and are known for their expertise in the forging and use of Extradimensional Matter (EM). An Atomcrafted tool will be comprised of modular components, constantly shifting to match the whims of the user who forged them. A firearm made from Extradimensional Matter will cycle through different firing modes depending on the skill of the user that crafted those components.

There have been 3 generations of Atomancers, with each subsequent generation's Atomcraft ability to bypass reality declining over time. While crafting modular components made of Extradimensional Matter that are lighter and stronger than any other material on Earth is no small feat, this is a far cry from previous generations, particularly Generation 0, who were the last humans to wield magic before vanishing without a trace. Since then, each generation has receded from importance, from being the ruling class with literal astronomical power bringing prosperity and defending humanity from cosmic entities, to estranged craftsmen and eccentrics living on the fringes of society.
